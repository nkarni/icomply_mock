        There are several ways in which you will be asked to pay money towards
        your legal aid:

            <strong>Contribution</strong>
            <div>
              We will work out how much you can afford to pay towards your case
              (a contribution). If you are in custody until your case is over,
              you may not be required to pay a contribution. If you are required
              to pay a contribution and do not pay, your lawyer does not have to
              do any work for you. We may change the amount you have to pay as
              your case progresses.

            <strong>Charge Over Your Real Estate</strong>
            <div>
              If you and/or a financially associated person own or are buying
              real estate we will take a charge over that real estate if your
              case costs exceed $2,280.00. The charge makes sure that you pay
              back the whole cost of your case eventually. We do not sell your
              real estate but when you decide to sell, transfer or refinance it,
              or if you die, we collect the money. Most cases, apart from simple
              guilty pleas or very short criminal trials, cost more than
              $2,280.00. Read our <a href="">charge brochure</a> and ask your
              lawyer about this.

        <ul class="list-group list-group-numbered list-group-flush">
          <li class="list-group-item">
            If you get money from your legal case, such as compensation, damages
            or property settlement, you will have to pay back your legal aid in
            full.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            If we take a charge, the charge makes sure that you pay back your

      <b-col>
        If you need to know the cost of your case from time to time, ask your
        lawyer. This is your responsibility, not ours. If you do not agree with
        your lawyer’s bill, you can have it checked by the Court, although you
        may have to pay for this.

            If you receive more money, e.g., if you get a job, an inheritance or
            other payment, or if you become financially supported by someone
            else, this will affect your legal aid. You must tell us if this
            happens. We will then work out whether you can still have legal aid
            and whether you have to pay another contribution.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you lose your case, you may have to pay the other side’s costs.
            We cannot help you with these costs. You will have to pay them
            yourself.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you get legal aid when you were not entitled to, we will require
            you to pay back the full amount. If you give us false, incomplete or
            misleading information, you could also be prosecuted.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can change the conditions of legal aid at any time and this could
            mean that you have to pay more.
          </li>
          <li>
            We cannot pay for any work your lawyer has already done without a
            grant of legal aid. This is your responsibility. You must also
            provide copies of relevant court orders, proceedings, summons, bail
            agreements etc., which relate to the application for legal aid, and
            which will assist our assessment.

             You must tell us and your lawyer if you change address. If you are
        released from prison, you must tell us and your lawyer where you will be
        living. If we cannot contact you, legal aid can be stopped and your
        lawyer can stop work on your case.
           </li>
           <li>
You must tell us and your lawyer
        if your financial circumstances change. This includes if you get a job,

        etc.

You must tell your lawyer everything they

           <li>
You must tell us and your lawyer if
        you do not want legal aid. By accepting legal aid you accept these
        conditions. Ask your lawyer if you are unsure.

      <b-col>
        We will process your application once we receive the completed form and
        proof of means. This takes us about 7-14 days. You can ring us after
        this time if you have not heard the outcome of your application. We will
        write to you telling you whether you are granted legal aid. The letter
        will tell you who your lawyer is and will ask you to contact them. It
        will also tell you about your contribution. If you are refused legal
        aid, the letter will tell you why and will explain how you can appeal.
        We will keep your legal aid matters confidential except in the following
        circumstances: (a) If you ask us in writing to provide information to
        someone else, or, again in writing, you authorise someone else to get
        information from us. (b) If there is information which your lawyer needs
        from us. (c) If we are required by law, including a court order, to
        release the information. (d) If we take a charge over your real estate,
        we send a copy of the charge document to your other lender(s) and the
        charge is registered at the Lands Titles Office.

      <b-col>
        (a) Your lawyer should keep you informed of the costs of your case,
        particularly when a charge has been taken over your real estate (b) Your
        lawyer must keep your case confidential, apart from some things which he
        or she must tell us, the other side and/or the Court. (c) Your lawyer is
        required to give us any information we need about your case whenever we
        ask for it. If your lawyer thinks that you are unlikely to win the case,
        he or she must tell us and legal aid can be stopped. (d) Your lawyer
        must tell us of any changes in your circumstances which could affect
        your legal aid. (e) Your lawyer cannot bill you for work done while you
        are on a grant of legal aid. Your lawyer will bill us for that work.

      <b-col>
        If you do not agree with our decision on your application, or with a
        condition of legal aid, you can appeal. To appeal, write to us within
        fourteen (14) days of our letter, telling us why you think the decision
        is wrong. You do not need a lawyer’s help to appeal. You can appeal by
        yourself, simply by writing a letter to us. Of course, you can pay a
        lawyer to appeal for you if you wish. We will write and let you know the
        result of your appeal. I have read and agree to the conditions of legal
        aid
