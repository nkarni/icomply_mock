        There are several ways in which you will be asked to pay money towards
        your Legal Aid:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
          <li >
            <strong>Contribution</strong>
            <div>
              We will work out how much you can afford to pay towards your case
              (a contribution). If you are in custody until your case is over,
              you may not be required to pay a contribution. If you are required
              to pay a contribution and do not pay, your lawyer does not have to
              do any work for you. We may change the amount you have to pay as
              your case progresses.

            <strong>Charge Over Your Real Estate</strong>
            <div>
              If you and/or a financially associated person own or are buying
              real estate we will take a charge over that real estate if your
              case costs exceed $2,280.00. The charge makes sure that you pay
              back the whole cost of your case eventually. We do not sell your
              real estate but when you decide to sell, transfer or refinance it,
              or if you die, we collect the money. Most cases, apart from simple
              guilty pleas or very short criminal trials, cost more than
              $2,280.00. Read our <a href="">charge brochure</a> and ask your
              lawyer about this.

        There are several ways in which you will be asked to pay money towards
        your Legal Aid:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
          <li >
            If you get money from your legal case, such as compensation, damages
            or property settlement, you will have to pay back your Legal Aid in
            full.
          </li>
          <li >
            If we take a charge, the charge makes sure that you pay back your
            Legal Aid in full.

      <b-col cols="4"><h6>Cost of your case</h6> </b-col>
      <b-col>
        <p>If you need to know the cost of your case from time to time, ask your
        lawyer. This is your responsibility, not ours. If you do not agree with
        your lawyerâ€™s bill, you can have it checked by the Court, although you
        may have to pay for this.</p>

        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>If you receive more money, e.g., if you get a job, an inheritance or other payment, or if you become financially supported by someone else, this will affect your Legal Aid. You must tell us if this happens. We will then work out whether you can still have Legal Aid and whether you have to pay another contribution.</li>
<li>If you lose your case, you may have to pay the other side&rsquo;s costs. We cannot help you with these costs. You will have to pay them yourself.</li>
<li>If you get Legal Aid when you were not entitled to, we will require you to pay back the full amount. If you give us false, incomplete or misleading information, you could also be prosecuted.</li>
<li>We can change the conditions of Legal Aid at any time and this could mean that you have to pay more.</li>
<li>We cannot pay for any work your lawyer has already done without a grant of Legal Aid. This is your responsibility. You must also provide copies of relevant Court Orders, proceedings, summons, bail agreements etc., which relate to the application for Legal Aid, and which will assist our assessment.</li>

<li>You must tell us and your lawyer if you change address. If you are released from prison, you must tell us and your lawyer where you will be living. If we cannot contact you, Legal Aid can be stopped and your lawyer can stop work on your case.</li>
<li>You must tell us and your lawyer if your financial circumstances change. This includes if you get a job, enter a financially associated relationship, separate, receive money, etc.</li>
<li>You must follow your lawyer&rsquo;s advice. Legal Aid can be stopped if you do not do this.</li>
<li>You must tell your lawyer everything they need to know about your case.</li>
<li>You must tell us and your lawyer if you do not want Legal Aid. By accepting Legal Aid you accept these conditions. Ask your lawyer if you are unsure.</li>

      <b-col>
      <p>We will process your application once we receive the completed form and proof of means. This takes us about 7-14 days. You can ring us after this time if you have not heard the outcome of your application.</p>
<p>We will write to you telling you whether you are granted Legal Aid. The letter will tell you who your lawyer is and will ask you to contact them. It will also tell you about your contribution. If you are refused Legal Aid, the letter will tell you why and will explain how you can appeal.</p>
<p>We will keep your Legal Aid matters confidential except in the following circumstances:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>If you ask us in writing to provide information to someone else, or, again in writing, you authorise someone else to get information from us.</li>
<li>If there is information which your lawyer needs from us.</li>
<li>If we are required by law, including a Court Order, to release the information.</li>
<li>If we take a charge over your real estate, we send a copy of the charge document to your other lender(s) and the charge is registered at the Lands Titles Office.</li>

<li>Your lawyer must keep your case confidential, apart from some things which he or she must tell us, the other side and/or the Court.</li>
<li>Your lawyer is required to give us any information we need about your case whenever we ask for it. If your lawyer thinks that you are unlikely to win the case, he or she must tell us and Legal Aid can be stopped.</li>
<li>Your lawyer must tell us of any changes in your circumstances which could affect your Legal Aid. (e) Your lawyer cannot bill you for work done while you are on a grant of Legal Aid. Your lawyer will bill us for that work.</li>

      <p>If you do not agree with our decision on your application, or with a condition of Legal Aid, you can appeal. To appeal, write to us within fourteen (14) days of our letter, telling us why you think the decision is wrong.</p>
<p>You do not need a lawyer&rsquo;s help to appeal. You can appeal by yourself, simply by writing a letter to us. Of course, you can pay a lawyer to appeal for you if you wish.</p>
