    <p>Welcome to Bidet!</h5>
    <p>
      In our quest to reduce or prevent harm caused by Bias in AI systems, we
      have created an online reporitory of detected Bias. Designers, developers
      and users of AI systems as well as researches and educators can report
      bias they detect in their systems, or apply to access it for the purpose
      of research (our exact terms of use of the data are still being worked
      out).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This Repository is free to use</li>
      <li>
        Registration is required (including a linkedin URL or other professional
        page)
      </li>
      <li>If datasets are provided they must be anonymised</li>
      <li>Your submissions can be peer reviewed if you chose to allow that</li>
      <li>
        At this stage no data will be shared pubicly or commercially, excpet for
        the purpose of peer review when you agree to it. Otherwise it will only
        be used to help in the development of an AI based Automatic Bias
        Detection System
